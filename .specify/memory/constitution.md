# Project Constitution

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Ratification Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Last Amended Date:** 2025-10-14

---

## Purpose

This constitution establishes the foundational principles and governance framework for this project. It serves as the supreme authority for all technical decisions, implementation choices, and quality standards. Every feature specification, architectural decision, and code contribution must align with these principles.

---

## Core Principles

### Principle 1: Code Quality Excellence

**Declaration:**  
All code MUST be maintainable, readable, and follow established best practices. We prioritize clarity over cleverness and long-term sustainability over short-term expediency.

**Non-Negotiable Rules:**
- All code MUST pass static analysis and linting checks before merge
- Code complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity) MUST remain within defined thresholds
- Every public API MUST have comprehensive documentation
- Code MUST follow consistent naming conventions and style guides
- Magic numbers and hardcoded values MUST be replaced with named constants
- Code duplication MUST be eliminated through proper abstraction
- All dependencies MUST be explicitly declared with version pinning

**Rationale:**  
High-quality code reduces technical debt, accelerates onboarding, minimizes bugs, and ensures the codebase remains sustainable as the team and project scale. Poor code quality compounds exponentially, creating maintenance burden that eventually becomes insurmountable.

**Compliance Criteria:**
- Pre-commit hooks enforce linting and formatting
- Pull request reviews MUST verify adherence to code standards
- Automated tools track and report on code quality metrics
- Quality gates prevent merging of substandard code

---

### Principle 2: Comprehensive Testing Standards

**Declaration:**  
Testing is not optional—it is an integral part of implementation. Every feature MUST be accompanied by appropriate tests that verify correctness, handle edge cases, and prevent regressions.

**Non-Negotiable Rules:**
- All new features MUST include unit tests achieving minimum 80% code coverage
- Critical business logic MUST have 100% branch coverage
- Integration tests MUST verify interactions between components
- End-to-end tests MUST validate critical user journeys
- Performance tests MUST establish and verify baseline metrics
- Tests MUST be deterministic, fast, and independent
- Broken tests MUST block all deployments
- Test code MUST follow the same quality standards as production code

**Rationale:**  
Comprehensive testing provides confidence in refactoring, catches regressions early, serves as living documentation, and enables rapid iteration without fear of breaking existing functionality. Untested code is legacy code from day one.

**Compliance Criteria:**
- CI/CD pipeline enforces coverage thresholds
- Test results are visible in all pull requests
- Flaky tests are treated as P1 bugs and fixed immediately
- Test suite execution time is monitored and optimized

---

### Principle 3: User Experience Consistency

**Declaration:**  
User experience MUST be consistent, intuitive, and accessible across all touchpoints. Users should never be surprised by inconsistent behavior, confusing interfaces, or accessibility barriers.

**Non-Negotiable Rules:**
- All UI components MUST follow the established design system
- Interaction patterns MUST be consistent across features
- All user-facing text MUST be clear, concise, and grammatically correct
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 Level AA minimum) MUST be met
- Error messages MUST be helpful and actionable
- Loading states and user feedback MUST be provided for all async operations
- Responsive design MUST support all target device sizes
- User flows MUST be tested with real users before major releases

**Rationale:**  
Consistency reduces cognitive load, builds user trust, and makes the product easier to learn and use. Inconsistent UX creates confusion, frustration, and support burden. Accessibility is both a moral imperative and legal requirement.

**Compliance Criteria:**
- Design reviews validate adherence to design system
- Automated accessibility testing runs in CI
- UX checklist is completed for all user-facing changes
- Usability testing sessions inform major feature releases
- Analytics track user interaction patterns and pain points

---

### Principle 4: Performance Requirements

**Declaration:**  
Performance is a feature, not an afterthought. Systems MUST respond within acceptable time bounds, scale efficiently, and use resources responsibly.

**Non-Negotiable Rules:**
- API endpoints MUST respond within defined SLA thresholds (typically <200ms p95)
- Page load time MUST meet Web Vitals standards (LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1)
- Database queries MUST be optimized and indexed appropriately
- N+1 query problems MUST be eliminated
- Memory leaks MUST be identified and fixed
- Resource usage MUST be monitored and alerted
- Performance budgets MUST be established and enforced
- Performance regressions MUST be caught before production

**Rationale:**  
Poor performance directly impacts user satisfaction, conversion rates, and operational costs. Performance problems are expensive to fix after the fact. Proactive performance engineering prevents issues before they affect users.

**Compliance Criteria:**
- Performance tests run automatically in CI
- Production monitoring tracks key performance indicators
- Performance budgets trigger alerts when violated
- Architecture reviews evaluate scalability implications
- Regular performance audits identify optimization opportunities

---

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure

1. **Proposal Phase:** Any team member may propose an amendment by creating a formal proposal document that:
   - Identifies the specific principle or section to be modified
   - Provides clear rationale for the change
   - Assesses impact on existing codebase and processes
   - Suggests implementation timeline

2. **Review Phase:** Proposals MUST be reviewed by:
   - Technical leadership
   - Affected team leads
   - At least 2 senior engineers

3. **Approval Phase:** Amendments require:
   - Unanimous approval from technical leadership
   - Majority approval from review participants
   - Documentation of dissenting opinions if any

4. **Implementation Phase:**
   - Constitution version MUST be incremented per semantic versioning
   - All dependent templates and documentation MUST be updated
   - Team MUST be notified and trained on changes
   - Transition period MUST be defined for existing work

### Versioning Policy

- **MAJOR (X.0.0):** Backward-incompatible changes, principle removals, fundamental governance restructuring
- **MINOR (X.Y.0):** New principles added, significant expansions to existing principles, new compliance requirements
- **PATCH (X.Y.Z):** Clarifications, typo fixes, wording improvements that don't change meaning

### Compliance Review

- All feature specifications MUST include a "Constitution Compliance" section
- Pull requests MUST reference relevant constitutional principles
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) MUST demonstrate constitutional alignment
- Quarterly audits MUST assess overall adherence to principles
- Violations MUST be documented and addressed with priority based on severity

### Exception Handling

Exceptions to constitutional principles are permitted ONLY when:
1. Technical constraints make compliance impossible (not just difficult)
2. Business-critical timeline requires temporary deviation
3. Exception is formally documented with:
   - Specific principle being violated
   - Justification and alternatives considered
   - Remediation plan with timeline
   - Approval from technical leadership
4. Exception is time-bound and tracked for resolution

### Enforcement

- Automated tooling MUST enforce objective principles (linting, coverage, performance)
- Code review process MUST validate subjective principles (design quality, UX consistency)
- CI/CD pipelines MUST block non-compliant code
- Team retrospectives MUST address constitutional adherence
- Repeated violations indicate need for principle revision or additional tooling/training

---

## Interpretation

When interpreting this constitution:
- Principle adherence takes precedence over convenience
- "MUST" indicates absolute requirements
- "SHOULD" indicates strong recommendations that may have exceptions with justification
- When principles appear to conflict, escalate to technical leadership for clarification
- The spirit of the constitution matters as much as the letter

---

## Commitment

By contributing to this project, all team members commit to:
- Understanding and following these principles
- Holding themselves and others accountable
- Proposing improvements when principles prove inadequate
- Prioritizing long-term project health over short-term convenience
- Fostering a culture of quality, testing, user focus, and performance excellence
