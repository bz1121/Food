# Specification Quality Checklist: TasteFinder 美食推荐平台

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-14  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)  
**Status**: ✅ Validation Passed

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes:**
- ✅ Specification successfully avoids technical implementation details
- ✅ Describes features from user perspective (what users can do, not how it's built)
- ✅ Language is business-focused and accessible to non-technical readers
- ✅ All required sections from template are present and filled

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes:**
- ✅ All requirements have clear, testable acceptance criteria
- ✅ Success metrics include specific numbers (DAU>1000, session>5min, success rate>90%)
- ✅ Success criteria focus on user outcomes, not technical implementation
- ✅ User flows cover primary and secondary scenarios
- ✅ Edge cases documented in testing strategy and risks
- ✅ Clear scope boundaries (5 user roles, specific features)
- ✅ Dependencies and assumptions explicitly listed

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes:**
- ✅ FR1-FR10 all have detailed acceptance criteria with checkboxes
- ✅ Primary flows: discover-navigate-review and search-collect documented
- ✅ Measurable outcomes: user growth, engagement rates, performance benchmarks
- ✅ Specification maintains abstraction from technical implementation

---

## Constitutional Compliance

- [x] Code Quality requirements specified (80% coverage, complexity ≤10)
- [x] Testing Standards defined (unit, integration, E2E, performance)
- [x] User Experience standards met (WCAG 2.1 AA, responsive, clear errors)
- [x] Performance requirements quantified (API <200ms, map load <3s)

**Validation Notes:**
- ✅ All four constitutional principles addressed in NFRs section
- ✅ Specific, measurable targets for each principle
- ✅ Constitution Compliance Summary section completed

## Open Items

The following items require clarification before proceeding to planning:

1. **地图服务API配额和成本预算** - 需要确认预算是否支持预期用户量
2. **餐厅数据来源和更新频率** - 需要确定数据合作伙伴
3. **国际化需求** - 是否需要支持多城市/多语言
4. **内容审核流程** - 用户生成内容的审核标准和流程
5. **支付/预订系统集成** - 是否在当前版本范围内

**Impact**: 这些开放问题不影响核心功能规范的完整性，但在实施计划阶段需要明确。建议在执行 `/speckit.clarify` 时重点讨论这些问题。

---

## Recommendation

**✅ APPROVED FOR PLANNING**

规范质量达标，所有核心内容完整且清晰。建议：

1. 执行 `/speckit.clarify` 解决开放问题
2. 与设计团队确认 UI mockups
3. 与技术团队评估地图服务API选型
4. 准备执行 `/speckit.plan` 开始实施计划
